{"name":"Firefly","tagline":"Visualization for FIRE simulations","body":"<img src=\"http://febret.github.io/firefly/screenshot.png\" width = 500/>\r\n\r\nFirefly is a visualization app for simulations generated by the FIRE galaxy formation simulation (http://galaxies.northwestern.edu/fire-simulations/)\r\n\r\nThe code is in python and runs using the Omegalib toolkit (https://github.com/uic-evl/omegalib)\r\n\r\nTo run firefly (after installing or building Omegalib) type\r\n```\r\n> orun firefly.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installation Notes ###\r\nTo use firefly, install Omegalib with point cloud support. You can enable this in the installer or using the omegalib maintenance tools (see https://github.com/uic-evl/omegalib/wiki/Building#installing-modules)\r\n\r\n### Data Preparation ###\r\nfirefly reads point cloud data from binary point cloud files (extension `.xyzb`). FIRE generated HDF5 files. To convert the HDF5 file to binary point cloud files you can use the included preprocess.py script. To run it, you will need **h5py installed** to read the HDF5 file in python.\r\n\r\n#### Installing H5PY ####\r\nInstructions for each operating system can be found here: http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html\r\n\r\nIn particular, do the following to install on OSX:\r\n```\r\n(If you do not have homebrew)> ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\r\n\r\n>brew install homebrew/science/hdf5\r\n\r\n(If you do not have pip installed)> sudo easy_install pip\r\n>sudo pip install h5py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Preprocessing the HDF5 Data ####\r\nCopy your file in the firefly directory and edit preprocess.py line 48:\r\n```\r\nf = h5py.File('FILE NAME HERE,'r')\r\n```\r\nYou can optionally the `extractPart` lines to change what data is extracted from the file. \r\n\r\nTo start the preprocessign step do\r\n```\r\n>python preprocess.py\r\n```\r\nAt the end of the preprocessing step (it will take a few minutes) you should have a set of files (`data_0.xyzb`, `data_1.xyzb` etc.) in the firefly directory. \r\n\r\nYou can now run firefly with `orun firefly.py`\r\n\r\n### Application controls ###\r\n- **A** pan left\r\n- **D** pan right\r\n- **W** move forward\r\n- **S** move backward\r\n- **R** pan up\r\n- **F** pan down\r\n- **Mouse drag** rotate view around data center\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
