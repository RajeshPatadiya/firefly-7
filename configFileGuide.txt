Useful Functions and Variables for loader.py

--------- Selecting Snapshots to load ---------

dataBase = string
Modify this variable to take a string if the source data is in multiple files.

datasetPath = string
If the source data originates from a single hdf5 file, modify this variable.

--------Camera Variables --------

pivotPosition = Vector(float x, float y, float z):
	sets the initial pivot point when rotating the galaxy upon starting the application
	
cameraPosition = Vector(float x, float y, float z):
	sets the initial camera position upon starting the application.

cameraOrientation = Quaternion.new_rotate_axis(float w, float ix, float iy, float iz)
	determines the initial camera orientation when starting the application.
	The camera orientation is measured using quaternions, with w representing the real component
	and ix, iy, and iz representing the imaginary components of each axis.
	
--------Display variables--------

scale = float
Scales down the entire 3d Dataset, useful if the dataset is too large.
This simplifies navigation.

pointCloudLoadOptions = string
The loader options string should be in the format: "50000 0:100000:X"
where X is the decimation level for the loader. The true decimation level is the product of the
loader decimation level and the display decimation level. Higher decimation levels result in fewer points being loaded.

dqDec = int
This sets the dynamic quality rendering mode. Higher number = faster rendering but
lower quality

--------Variable Paths--------

loaderScript= string
This is the name of the script we want to use to load the file. Different simulation
snapshots might be outputting different DataParts / columns. You can have a different
loader script for each simulation output config.

imagePath = string
Set to a string, it will specify the destination path that
	screenshots taken will be saved to.

presetPath = string 
Set to a string, it will specify the destination path that
	the	presets will be loaded and saved to.
